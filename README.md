Code to render reports:
## creates a list of all 6 desired params from online
data_channel_is <- c("Lifestyle", "Entertainment", "Business", "Social.Media", "Tech", "World")

## creates the output file name 
output_file <- paste0(data_channel_is, ".md")

#create a list for each channel with just the channel name parameter
params = lapply(data_channel_is, FUN = function(x){list(DataChannel = x)})

#put into a data frame
reports <- tibble(output_file, params)

## renders with params to all based on rows in reports
apply(reports, MARGIN=1, FUN = function(x){
## change first path to your Rmd  and output_dir to whatever folder you want it to output to   
rmarkdown::render('C:/Documents/Github/ST_558_Project_2/_Rmd/ST_558_project_2', output_dir = "./automations_test2_html", output_file = x[[1]], params = x[[2]]
    )
  }
